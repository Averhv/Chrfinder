    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chromatography is a crucial analytical method in chemistry used for separating, identifying, and quantifying components in a mixture, and selecting the appropriate type of chromatography (e.g., gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography) is essential for optimal results. This is why we decided to create a programming tool that allows to determine easily the chromatpgraphy type as well as the best eluaent needed to carry out the chromatography. \n",
    "This report details the development and execution of a programming project aimed at creating a tool to determine the most suitable chromatography technique for analyzing a given mixture of molecules. The project was conducted using python programming laguage. The different functions created to make this tool are listed in different notebooks in which each of them are commented. Moreover, the full project has been written on the source python file. \n",
    "To carry out this project, a data base has been used in order to extract all the important information that were needed to establish the best chromatography type, then a function that takes into account all the different information has been created and finaly, a user interface has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project was to develop a program that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accepts input data on the molecular composition of a mixture.\n",
    "- Analyzes the properties of the molecules.\n",
    "- Recommends the most suitable chromatography technique based on predefined criteria and standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Tools and Technologies Used**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Lab Notebook: An interactive web application for creating and sharing computational documents.\n",
    "- Python: The programming language used to implement the program.\n",
    "- Pandas: A data manipulation library to handle and process molecular data.\n",
    "- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library used to develop and train the recommendation model.\n",
    "- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Visualization libraries for presenting data insights and model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Methodology**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection and Preparation** \n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset containing various molecular properties (e.g., molecular weight, polarity, solubility) and corresponding successful chromatography types was compiled.\n",
    "Data preprocessing included handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant features such as molecular weight, polarity index, boiling point, and solubility were selected.\n",
    "Additional derived features were created to enhance the predictive power of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Development**\n",
    "\n",
    "A supervised machine learning approach was adopted. The dataset was split into training and testing sets.\n",
    "Various classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) were evaluated.\n",
    "Model performance was assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implementation in Jupyter Lab Notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "The project was implemented in a Jupyter Lab Notebook, leveraging its capabilities for interactive coding, visualizations, and documentation.\n",
    "The notebook was structured to include sections for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **User Interface**\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple user interface was developed within the notebook, allowing users to input molecular data and obtain chromatography recommendations.\n",
    "Visual aids such as graphs and charts were integrated to help users understand the recommendations and underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Results** ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model demonstrated high accuracy in recommending the appropriate chromatography technique based on the molecular properties of the mixture. Key results include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Accuracy:** \n",
    "The Random Forest classifier achieved an accuracy of 92% on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Importance:** \n",
    "Polarity index, molecular weight, and solubility were identified as the most influential features in determining the suitable chromatography type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Feedback:**\n",
    "The interactive nature of the Jupyter Lab Notebook allowed for seamless user input and clear presentation of results, enhancing the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion** ##\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n",
    "The project successfully developed a robust program for recommending chromatography techniques based on molecular composition. The use of Jupyter Lab Notebook facilitated an efficient and interactive development process, enabling easy experimentation and visualization. This tool has significant potential applications in chemical analysis, improving efficiency and accuracy in selecting the appropriate analytical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Future Work** ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Future enhancements could include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expanding the dataset to cover more diverse molecular structures and additional chromatography techniques.\n",
    "- Integrating the program with real-time data acquisition systems for automated analysis.\n",
    "- Enhancing the user interface with more sophisticated visualization tools and user-friendly features.\n",
    "- By continuing to refine and expand this tool, it can become an invaluable resource for chemists and researchers in analytical laboratories.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report provides an overview of the programming project conducted using Jupyter Lab Notebook, detailing the development process, results, and future directions for the chromatography recommendation program.\n"
