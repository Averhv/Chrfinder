    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chromatography is a crucial analytical method in chemistry used for separating, identifying, and quantifying components in a mixture, and selecting the appropriate type of chromatography (e.g., gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography) is essential for optimal results. This is why we decided to create a programming tool that allows to determine easily the chromatpgraphy type as well as the best eluaent needed to carry out the chromatography. \n",
    "This report details the development and execution of a programming project aimed at creating a tool to determine the most suitable chromatography technique for analyzing a given mixture of molecules. The project was conducted using python programming laguage. The different functions created to make this tool are listed in different notebooks in which each of them are commented. Moreover, the full project has been written on the source python file. \n",
    "To carry out this project, a data base has been used in order to extract all the important information that were needed to establish the best chromatography type, then a function that takes into account all the different information has been created and finaly, a user interface has been created.\n",

    "## **Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project was to develop a program that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accepts input data on the molecular composition of a mixture.\n",
    "- Analyzes the properties of the molecules.\n",
    "- Recommends the most suitable chromatography technique based on predefined criteria and standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Used Packages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tkinter: used to create a Graphical User Interface \n",
    "- Pandas: used to create a data frame in which all the properties are added\n",
    "- Pubchemprops: used to retrieve most of the properties of the molecules from pubchem (missing pKa)\n",
    "- pka_lookup.py: A function written by Khoi Van which request the needed dictionnary of strings on PubChem.\n",

If an error occurs, an error message will be displayed using a message box on the user interface.\n",
